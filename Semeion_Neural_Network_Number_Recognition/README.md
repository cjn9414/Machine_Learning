The purpose of this project is to create, train, and test a neural network whose function is to recognize a digit from an image. I will be training this neural network using a set of 1593 images, each with a size of 16x16 pixels. These images come from the Semeion Handwritten Digit Data Set. Information on this dataset can be found using the link below:

The index of this database is located below:

In order to use this Neural Network, please go to the link above, and download "semeion.data". These files should be placed in the same directory that this repository has been downloaded to.

This project is being done in Octave, and will be my first independent project in this language. I expect to continue to use Octave, along with other languages as I continue to learn and incorporate machine learning algorithms in various projects of mine. This is also the first neural network I have created. The images used in training and testing this neural network are very non-complex, but as I become more comfortable with creating neural networks I will further challenge myself with more complicated problems.

I am also using a function minimizer, fmincg, which will find the minimum value of a function with respect to one variable. This function is not mine. If you wish to use my program, please download fmincg from the git repository located below. This file should be located in the same folder that this repository is being downloaded to.
