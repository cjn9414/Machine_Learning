This repository is being used to interpret a set of 16000 images originating from the Four Shapes Dataset. This dataset contains images of stars, squares, circles, and triangles, all of which are rotated freely. I am going to attempt to use a clustering algorithm in order to accurately classify these four shapes in the dataset. I am going to create this program using the programming language Octave.

The link to the dataset is located below:
