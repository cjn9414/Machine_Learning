The purpose of this project is to create, train, and test a neural network whose function is to recognize a digit from an image. I will be training this neural network using a set of 73257 images, each with a size of 32x32 pixels. These images come from The Street View House Numbers Dataset (SVHN). I will also be using a set of images from the same dataset to test my neural network and report its accuracy. The link to the website for SVHN is located below:

In order to use this Neural Network, please go to the link above, and download "train_32x32.mat" and "test_32x32.mat". These files should be placed in the same directory that this repository has been downloaded to.

This project is being done in Octave, and will be my first independent project in this language. I expect to continue to use Octave, along with other languages as I continue to learn and incorporate machine learning algorithms in various projects of mine.
